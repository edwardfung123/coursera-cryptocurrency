# coursera-cryptocurrency

I enrolled the course [Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency/#) on Coursera. Overall it is a very good course.
The assignments are about implementing a "node" in the BitCoin network.
My implementation based on the following references:

1. The official course discussion forum;
2. [mslib/cousera-cryptocurrency](https://github.com/msilb/coursera-cryptocurrency)
3. [keskival/cryptocurrency-course-materials](https://github.com/keskival/cryptocurrency-course-materials)
